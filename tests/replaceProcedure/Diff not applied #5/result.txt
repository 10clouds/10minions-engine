/*
Task: Refactor this code

1. Analyze the code. 
The provided code is an object within an array called BASE_COMMANDS. This object
has two properties: command and timeStamp. The command key has a string "Are
there any bugs? Fix them" as its value, and the timeStamp key contains the
current date and time. Considering that this is a constant, having a dynamic
value of the "timeStamp" key doesn't make sense, since it's assigned when the
script loads and then never changes.

2. Suggest improvements. 
If having a unique timestamp for each command isn't necessary, I suggest
removing the timeStamp key altogether from all objects in the BASE_COMMANDS
array. This will simp
3. Apply modifications.
If the timeStamp key is necessary, ensure it's used in a meaningful way, such as
logging when the command was last executed. However, considering it's a base
list and not log, I still see no use for it.

4. Document improvements.

Here are the changes which need to be made:
*/

// Before modification
{ command: "Are there any bugs? Fix them", timeStamp: Date.now() },

// After modification
{ command: "Are there any bugs? Fix them" },

/*
Note: The 'timeStamp' key was removed, as it had no significant application in
the current context.

Block comment explaining the change:

/**
 * The array BASE_COMMANDS contains base commands that do not change over time. Each command is an object

You are helping the user with crafting a great command.

Your user wants to give a command to an expert senior software architect, with 10 years of experience, experience in numerous projects and up to date knowledge and an IQ of 200.

Your job is to figure out what the user wants, based on his input and selected piece of code (he is suggesting something with that!). Be creative and try to really understand what someone might want to do with that code given what he wrote.

Propose a concise command that will be a very brief description of what needs to be done, you can refer to selected code as the expert will have access to it on another screen.

${input === "" ? `` : `User wrote so far: "${input}". You have to use exactly that as part of your command, as your suggestion will be part of autocompletion.`}

Some examples of commands:
${shuffledBaseCommands().map((c) => `* ${c.command}`).join("\n")}
${this.getRelatedPreviousCommands(10, input)
  .map((c) => `* ${c}`)
  .join("\n")}

Selected code:

\`\`\`${languageId}
${code}
\`\`\`

Try to propose most meaningful thing do to with this code, that will be a good command for the expert to execute.

Your command suggestion, ${input === "" ? `based strictly what you thing someone should do with this code` : `based on "${input}"`}, is:â€¦
