I will replace the BASE_COMMANDS array with a simplified version that only contains the command property for each object. The timeStamp property will be removed as it doesn't serve a meaningful purpose in this context. 

REPLACE
```typescript
const BASE_COMMANDS = [
  { command: "Refactor this", timeStamp: Date.now() },
  { command: "Clean this up", timeStamp: Date.now() },
  { command: "How does this work?", timeStamp: Date.now() },
  { command: "Document this", timeStamp: Date.now() },
  { command: "Write tests for this", timeStamp: Date.now() },
  { command: "Make this UI look pretty", timeStamp: Date.now() },
  { command: "Rename this to something sensible", timeStamp: Date.now() },
  { command: "Are there any bugs? Fix them", timeStamp: Date.now() },
  { command: "Rework this so now it also does X", timeStamp: Date.now() },
  { command: "Optimize this for performance", timeStamp: Date.now() },
  { command: "Add error handling to this", timeStamp: Date.now() },
  { command: "Implement this functionality", timeStamp: Date.now() },
  { command: "Migrate this to a different library", timeStamp: Date.now() },
  { command: "Refactor this to use design pattern X", timeStamp: Date.now() },
  { command: "Integrate this with external service X", timeStamp: Date.now() },
];
```
WITH
```typescript
/**
 * The array BASE_COMMANDS contains base commands that do not change over time. Each command is an object 
 * with the 'command' property. The 'timeStamp' property was set to the current 
 * date and time whenever the script was loaded. Since these are base commands, and the timeStamp wasn't 
 * relevant to the context, the 'timeStamp' property were removed, and only the 'command' property were kept. 
 * This change simplifies the structure and usage of the BASE_COMMANDS array objects.
