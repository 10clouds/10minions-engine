I will start by creating an interface named IStage with properties name (string), weight (number), and execution (function). Then, I will define a Stage class that implements the IStage interface. After that, I will replace the plain objects in the STAGES array with instances of the Stage class. Finally, I will move the STAGES array and the TOTAL_WEIGHTS constant into a separate module named stageConstants.ts and update the import statements in the current file to import the STAGES array and the TOTAL_WEIGHTS constant from stageConstants.ts.

REPLACE
```javascript
export const STAGES = [
  {
    name: "Starting ...",
    weight: 10,
    execution: stageStarting,
  },
  {
    name: "Understanding ...",
    weight: 50,
    execution: stageClassifyTask,
  },
  {
    name: "Conceptualising ...",
    weight: 100,
    execution: stageCreateModification,
  },
  {
    name: "Preparing Changes ...",
    weight: 80,
    execution: stageCreateModificationProcedure,
  },
  /*{
    name: "Applying Changes ...",
    weight: 10,
    execution: stageApplyModificationProcedure,
  },
  {
    name: "Preparing Changes (retry) ...",
    weight: 40,
    execution: stageCreateModificationProcedure,
  },
  {
    name: "Applying Changes (retry) ...",
    weight: 10,
    execution: stageApplyModificationProcedure,
  },
  {
    name: "Applying changes as comment (fall back) ...",
    weight: 10,
    execution: stageFallingBackToComment,
  },*/
  {
    name: "Finishing ...",
    weight: 10,
    execution: stageFinishing,
  },
];

export const TOTAL_WEIGHTS = STAGES.reduce((acc, stage) => {
  return acc + stage.weight;
}, 0);
```
WITH
```javascript
interface IStage {
  name: string;
  weight: number;
  execution: Function;
}

class Stage implements IStage {
  constructor(public name: string, public weight: number, public execution: Function) {}
}

import { STAGES, TOTAL_WEIGHTS } from './stageConstants';
```
