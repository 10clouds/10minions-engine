I will perform two REPLACE operations. The first REPLACE operation will be to import the `glob` library at the top of the file. The second REPLACE operation will be to replace the `testDirs` array with a call to `glob.sync()`. This will dynamically load the directories instead of using the hard-coded array.

REPLACE
```typescript
import * as assert from "assert";
import { fuzzyReplaceText } from "../../utils/fuzzyReplaceText";
import { readFileSync } from "fs";
import * as path from 'path';
```
WITH
```typescript
import * as assert from "assert";
import { fuzzyReplaceText } from "../../utils/fuzzyReplaceText";
import { readFileSync } from "fs";
import * as path from 'path';
import * as glob from 'glob';
```
END_REPLACE

REPLACE
```typescript
let testDirs = [
  "replaceReal1",
  "replaceReal2",
];
```
WITH
```typescript
let testDirs = glob.sync(path.resolve(baseDir, 'replaceReal*'));
```
END_REPLACE
