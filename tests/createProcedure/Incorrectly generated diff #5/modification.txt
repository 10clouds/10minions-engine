Firstly, the task involves taking two existing parts of the code: `document.uri` and `selection` and adjusting the command to include them in the `arguments` field. 

The command in question, `{ command: "10minions.executeTask", title: "Execute task", arguments: [todoMessage] }`, is used to trigger a task execution. 

It seems `todoMessage` is already provided as an argument to the command. Now, we're asked to add `document.uri` and `selection`.

`document.uri` represents the resource identifier for the document which essentially is the location of the document. `selection` represents a region of the text document which may be selected for performing some operation.

The first step is to confirm the availability and correct places of these parameters in our code. It seems these parameters are used in the `executeTask` method, and that `selection` is calculated within the method itself using `lineNumber`.

We need to calculate `selection` within `provideCodeLenses` method, as it is not available directly like `document.uri`. We'll create the range for the `selection` similar to how the `range` for `todoCodeLens` is created.

Now let's make the changes:

```typescript
{
  // Modified block, we have added the document uri and selection to the command arguments.
  
  const rangeForSelection = new vscode.Range(new vscode.Position(lineNum, match.index), new vscode.Position(lineNum, match.index + match[0].length));
  const selection = new vscode.Selection(rangeForSelection.start, rangeForSelection.end);
  const todoCodeLens = new vscode.CodeLens(range, { command: "10minions.executeTask", title: "Execute task", arguments: [document.uri, selection, todoMessage] });
  todoLocations.push(todoCodeLens);
}
```

In the above block, I added `document.uri` and `selection` parameters to the arguments list of the `10minions.executeTask` command in the `TodoCodeLensProvider - provideCodeLenses` method. The `Selection` object is created similarly as the `Range` object was created. I used `Range` to create `Selection` because `Selection` in vscode is just a `Range` with active and anchor positions.

With this addition, whenever the `10minions.executeTask` command is invoked, it now has access to the `document.uri` and `selection` in addition to `todoMessage`. 

Remember to also modify the code at `vscode.commands.registerCommand("10minions.executeTask"` to accept the newly added arguments.
