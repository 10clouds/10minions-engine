Firstly, before making any modifications, let's analyze what is currently happening in the getCachedResult() function.

The function is making a hash of the requestData object, checking if there are any cached results left for that specific request, using the generated hash as a key, and returning a cached result that was stored in an array.

The provided task asks to modify the function behavior, so when the cache[requestDataHash] is already empty, which means all previously retrieved cached results for that specific requestData was already returned to the consumer, the function should return undefined.

Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the task:

1. Check if cache[requestDataHash] is defined and if its length is 0 after we try to retrieve a result from the cache with the shift() function.
2. If the length is 0, which means there is no more data left in the array, we will just return undefined.

Following is the updated and commented code where modifications were needed.

```tsx
public async getCachedResult(requestData: object): Promise<string | undefined> {
  if (!this.firestore) {
    return undefined;
  }

  const requestDataHash = getAnalyticsManager().getRequestHash(requestData);

  if (this.cache[requestDataHash] && this.cache[requestDataHash].length > 0) {
    // Store the result to a variable, so we can check if the array is empty after removal of the cached result
    const result = this.cache[requestDataHash].shift();
    
    // Check is array is empty after removal of the result, if it's empty, we return undefined as per the task directions.
    if (this.cache[requestDataHash].length === 0) {
      return undefined;
    }
    
    return result;
  }

  const snapshot = await this.firestore.collection('openAICalls').where('requestDataHash', '==', requestDataHash).get();

  if (snapshot.empty) {
    return undefined;
  }

  snapshot.forEach((doc) => {
    if (typeof doc.data().responseData === "string") {
      if(this.cache[requestDataHash]) {
        this.cache[requestDataHash].push(doc.data().responseData as string);
      } else {
        this.cache[requestDataHash] = [doc.data().responseData as string];
      }
    }
  });

  // Duplicate of the code above, this also has to be modified
  const result = this.cache[requestDataHash].shift();
    
  if (this.cache[requestDataHash].length === 0) {
    return undefined;
  }
  
  return result;
}
```

The parts of the code that were modified were the two places where we returned a result retrieved from the cache. By storing the result to a variable before returning it, we could add a check after the result was removed to determine whether the cached results for the provided requestData are empty now, and if so, then return undefined as per the task's requirement.
