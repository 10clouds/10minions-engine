First, we need to define a voice dictionary. In the provided context, voice details are hard-coded as separate objects. We should refactor this to make it more maintainable.

Step 1: Remove the hard-coded voice details and objects and replace them with a dictionary. I would do this by creating an object where the name of each voice is the key and the properties of each voice are properties of an inner object.

Step 2: Once the dictionary has been created, I will choose a random voice. I can do this using the Math.random() method which provides a random float between 0 and 1. I will multiply this by the number of entries in the dictionary and take the floor to get an integer. I will then fetch the voice with this index.

Step 3: Finally, I will print the name and the voice_id of the chosen voice.

Here is the code:

```typescript
// Step 1: Define voice dictionary
const voices = {
    "Rachel": { "voice_id": "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM" },
    "Domi": { "voice_id": "AZnzlk1XvdvUeBnXmlld" },
    "Bella": { "voice_id": "EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL" },
    "Antoni": { "voice_id": "ErXwobaYiN019PkySvjV" },
    // ...add the rest of the voice
    "Young American Woman With a Clear Voice": { "voice_id": "vutxYyExFrSlPzi5bvvT" },
    "Expressive Romance Language Female Narrator": { "voice_id": "zFqGEeoWCQASMvmV6c49" },
}

// Step 2: Get a random voice
const voiceNames = Object.keys(voices);
const randomVoiceName = voiceNames[Math.floor(Math.random() * voiceNames.length)];

// Step 3: Print the name and id of the chosen voice
console.log("Selected voice: ", randomVoiceName); 
console.log("Voice Id: ", voices[randomVoiceName].voice_id);
```

Remember to replace the comment `// ...add the rest of the voice` with the rest of the voice data.

This not only accomplishes the task but also makes it easier to update, maintain, and use the voices in other parts of the code, since we now have a dictionary of voices instead of a hard-coded list.
